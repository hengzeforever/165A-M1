## Overview
This project aims to create a simple model of real-time OLTP and\
OLAP system (L-store). It is an update-friendly lineage-based storage\
architecture that enables a contention-free update mechanism over a\
native multi-version, columnar storage model in order to lazily\
and independently stage stable data from a write-optimized\
columnar layout (i.e., OLTP) into a read-optimized columnar\
layout (i.e., OLAP)
